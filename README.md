# somewhere-safe

A place to hold things we want to keep safe, but aren't big enough to warrant their own repository

If it's just general text, a page on the [wiki](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/wiki/wiki) is probably a better location.  This repository is more useful for storing files - PDFs, SVGs, etc. - that can't easily be stored in the wiki.

## Contents

 * [events](events) - text, etc. for event applications
 * [HannahDirectoryCopy](HannahDirectoryCopy) - text that was included in our entry in the Hannah Directory
 * [logos](logos) - copies of useful logos to put on things
 * [Network](Network) - things related to the online/networking part of DoES Liverpool
 * [Parking](Parking) - advice for parking when visiting DoES Liverpool
 * [Workshop](Workshop) - files related to, or to be used with, the equipment in the Workshop
