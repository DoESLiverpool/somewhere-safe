DoES Liverpool is a community:

First and foremost DoES Liverpool is a community of people with a diverse range of skills and interests. By joining the DoES community you will get to mingle with entrepreneurs and company founders, artists and makers, developers and hardware engineers, academics and students (and many people that are less easy to label).

DoES Liverpool is a place:

We are a co-working space located in the heart of Liverpool. Desks are available to rent by the month or by the day.  The DoES workshop is well equipped with a range of electronics equipment, 3d printers, vacuum former, CNC mill and laser cutters.

DoES Liverpool host events:

DoES Liverpool organises a range of regular and semi-regular events. We also host a number of events run by different people.

DoES Liverpool is a company:

We are a Community Interest Company. This means that any profit we make is fed back to help the community â€“ making the space bigger, or buying more useful bits of kit. 

This year, we're showing DoES Liverpool's biggest collaborative projects:

 * A Kinitic circular knitting machine; 3D printed, laser cut, Arduino powered and all build by community members, 
 * DoES Tower; a 1m high, 3D printed, light-up model of the Radio City Tower in Liverpool. Tweet @DoESTower with a colour to change the lights and receive a picture and message from the tower bot,
 * Made Invaders; a large scale live-action computer game, with foam dart guns, animated sprite targets and a live chiptunes soundtrack. Register at the desk for free and see if you can get the highest score in 30 seconds this weekend!
