# Events

Files that are useful for things that we take, or that we prep when we're going to, an event.

## Exhibit Labels

When showing things off (e.g. at MakeFest) it's useful to have a label to explain to people what the item is.  For "gallery style" labels, we've used the style in [Exhibit-Labels.odt](Exhibit-Labels.odt), printed out onto A4 paper, then spray-mounted to some foamcore and cut out with a Stanley knife.
