# DoES Liverpool Software Infrastructure

We use a collection of services and pieces of software - some off-the-shelf, others developed in-house - to help with the smooth running of the space/community.

## Promotional/Comms

 * Google Group - main online discussion group (used as a mailing list)
 * Mailchimp - announcements list
 * Twitter - @doesliverpool
 * Instagram - @doesliverpool
 * Slack - more immediate chat group
 * Facebook 
 * Weeknote-generator script runs once-a-week to create a blog post

## Informational

 * The main [doesliverpool.com](http://doesliverpool.com) website.  Built on Wordpress.  Main public-facing website.
 * [Main wiki](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/wiki/wiki).  Holds the non-sensitive information about the space and community, processes, equipment, etc.
 * Restricted-access wiki.  The place where account details and other sensitive information is held, accessible to organisers and directors.
 * [status.doesliverpool.com](http://status.doesliverpool.com) tracks the status of a variety of DoES Liverpool services and equipment, mostly automatically from the "Broken" label in the Somebody Should issue list.

## Financial

 * FreeAgent is used to manage the accounts
 * PayPal for additional payments
 * iZettle for credit card payments

## Administrative

 * Google spreadsheet to track people's visits and predict cashflow
 * Doorbot code contains the nearest we have to a member database, and controls access to the different rooms in the space
 * Somebody Should issue list tracks to-do items
 * SupportBee as a help-desk back-end to ease distribution of handling email enquiries to hello@doesliverpool.com
 * Google calendars to manage:
   * bookings for the laser-cutters
   * inductions on the laser-cutters
   * bookings for meetings in Dinky
   * booking hot-desks
   * availability of organisers to open/close the space each day
   * events/meetups happening at the space
 * YouCanBookMe to provide an easier booking system for members to book the laser-cutters, an induction, hot-desks, meetings in Dinky

# Types of User

Who interacts with DoES Liverpool, and in what sort of way?  These roles aren't always exclusive - i.e. one person could be a maintenance team member at one point, and a member booking a desk at another time...

 * Member of the public.  Doesn't know anything (or much) about DoES Liverpool, is encountering us for the first time
 * Event attendee
 * Event organiser
 * Casual user.  Hot-desks from time to time, or books the laser every now and then when they need it
 * Regular user
 * User with out-of-hours access
 * Member
 * Maintainer.  Someone who is fixing or performing routine maintenance on a piece of equipment or on the space in general
 * Organiser.  Someone who answers the door and/or the phone, and potentially email discussions
 * Maintenance team member
 * Grievance team member
 * Administrator
 * Director

# Improvements

There's a slow project under way to consolidate/improve some of the systems.  Not everything must be integrated into a seamless all-singing-and-dancing app, in fact, the principle of small pieces, loosely joined is more appealing.  However, better joining of the systems to ease the administrative overhead would be good, so the first step is identifying what should be replaced and what new connecting code should be developed.

The following Somebody Should issues are related to this (and provide additional background):
 * [We need a system for managing hot desk use #45](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/45)
 * [User Management #175](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/175)
 * [There should be a better way of adding people to the doorbots #166](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/166)
 * (this isn't intended to be an exhaustive list, just to provide some useful jumping off points for more info)
