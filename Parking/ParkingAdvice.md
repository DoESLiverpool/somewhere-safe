##DoES Liverpool Parking

There are no parking facilities at DoES for disabled badge holders or other visitors unfortunately.

Here is a google map with nearest Accessible parking options with additional notes made by one of our members with limited mobility but not a wheelchair user.

You will have to assess the locations yourself and safety and suitability of each one but be aware Hanover Street is
a very busy street on a main Bus Route and with sudden moving vehicles loading and unloading at all times.
